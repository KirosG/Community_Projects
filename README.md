# GA -Projects

This repo contains different projects i have accomplished while taking the Data science immersive program.

The projects include 
   1. Statistical Analysis of SAT and ACT examinations : This repo contains different visualizations using seaborn, matplotlib as        well as plotly for interactive visualizations.
   2. Predicting Titanic survival rate using machine learing.
     Overview the data has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv), test set (test.csv). The training set will be used       to build the  supervised machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground       truth”) for each passenger. The model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature      engineering to create new features.The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the        test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger       in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
   3. Reddit-NLP: The application of web scrabing and natural language processing
